RA      RA position

DEC     DEC position
dDEC    DEC position uncertainty
a0      Stokes I flux model coefficient a0
a1      Stokes I flux model coefficient a1
a2      Stokes I flux model coefficient a2
a3      Stokes I flux model coefficient a3
fq      fractional Stokes Q

fv      fractional Stokes V

The log convention used to express the integrated spectrum is the Baars polynomial:
log10(S) = a0 + a1*log10(v) + a2*log10(v)**2 + a3*log10(v)**3
**where v is measured in GHz**, contrary to the MHz convention used in KATpoint.
